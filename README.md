UML sequence diagram showing how requesting and receiving data works. Make it detailed enough that your partner (and your grader) will understand

### REQUEST Data Instructions
On your local machine, run the sample.py program. Click 'Submit' in the window that populates.
In the terminal, you will be prompted to "Enter number of clients", type '1'.

{This feature allows you to request multiple profiles at once, but for the sample, just ask for 1}

At this point, on your local machine run 'main.py'. Click 'Login'. You will see a window with several
options. Click 'Send Profile to Request Workout', in the window that pops up, enter the name of the profile
file name (the default is profile.txt, which I have previously generated by filling out the registration form
within my app).

### RECEIVE Data Instructions
You will now see in the sample.py terminal "Received successfully! New filename is: " followed by the name of the
file. This should be in the same folder from which you have been running these programs.
